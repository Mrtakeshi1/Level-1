    (Back Story)
    The Spencer Mansion was constructed in the Arklay Mountains in the 1960s by George Trevor,
    an architect who subsequently disappeared. The mansion housed an underground laboratory used by Umbrella Pharmaceuticals 
    for top-secret bio-weapons development on behalf of the US military. Soon after the completion of the "Îµ strain" virus in 1998, 
    the virus broke out and infected the staff, causing noticeable necrosis of the skin and severe brain damage that limits their 
    intelligence and triggers the excessive production of hormones, making them murderously angry, obsessively hungry, 
    and causing them to grow several inches. In their volatile state, they were unable to prevent their mutant test subjects from escaping, 
    leading to a number of deaths of hikers and suburban factories. In July 1998, the Raccoon Police Department, 
    unable to solve the murder and animal attack cases, handed over the investigation to S.T.A.R.S., 
    an elite law enforcement unit funded by Umbrella. (Press Enter to Continue)
